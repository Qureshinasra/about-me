        <p>Play is a range of intrinsically motivated activities done for recreational pleasure and enjoyment.
            [1] Play is commonly associated with children and juvenile-level activity but may be engaged in at any life stage, 
            and among other higher-functioning animals as well, most notably mammals and birds.</p>
